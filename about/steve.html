<p>Hi, I&rsquo;m Steve Blatchford. I spent 13 years as a co-founder of an
Internet service provider, porchlight.ca. I started the business as a
hobby in 1995 while I completed high school. In 1999 I met Jim and
became much more focused.</p>

<p>With the ISP, I directed the growth of an Internet service, starting
from my parents basement to a successful business with 21 employees
servicing over 18,000 customers. In 2003, I oversaw the development of
the company brand and established a marketing strategy that quadrupled
sales to $1.8 million in 2004. Under my direction the company maintained
steady sales of at least $1.7 million for five years peaking at $2.3
million in 2005 before it was sold at the end of 2008.</p>

<p>Currently Jim, and I are working with <a href="http://ellwoodepps.com">sporting goods
company</a>, helping them automate certain tasks.</p>

<p>I have many years of experience working with computer hardware, Linux,
networks and Bash. I have good brainstorming skills. I have a knack for
whittling problems to their core, and designing simple, common sense
solutions. I am comfortable in small groups, engaging and motivating,
with a strong sense of direction and persistence to meet goals. In my
free time I enjoy playing ultimate, talking with my wife, and
entertaining our two dogs.</p>
