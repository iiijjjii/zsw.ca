#### Work Environment
Jim and I are very casual. Our work has become a lifestyle. We spend most of
the day at the keyboard. There is a lot of collaboration: discussions about
general directions and goals, brainstorming sessions, and sharing suggestions
and discoveries. And then there is a lot of self-directed work: researching
technologies and techniques, developing and implementing solutions, testing and
bug fixing.

Jim and I setup the basement of my house as our work environment. Below are some
photos.
