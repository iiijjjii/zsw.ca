#### Work Environment
Jim and I are very casual. Our work as become a lifestyle. We spend most
of the day at the keyboard. He and I setup the basement of a house as
our work environment. Below are some photos. Before selling the ISP we
worked out of a condo in downtown Kitchener. During that time we worked
in [cubicles](/questions.html#cubicles).  We liked them so much we kept
a few from the sale.
