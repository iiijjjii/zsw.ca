Hi, I'm Jim Karsten. I spent the 9 years developing Internet
applications for the Internet service provider, porchlight.ca. With
porchlight.ca, I managed a team of programmers.  We developed many
applications including an automated call centre, a project management
system, payroll and accounting programs, applicant screening tools for
human resources, and web pages for customers to maintain their accounts
online.

I love to code in python and am fluent in HTML, CSS, javascript, git and
svn, and MySQL. I have a user-level knowledge of Linux, Bash and
networking. In my free time, I enjoy playing ultimate, hockey and golf.
