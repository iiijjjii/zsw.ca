Hi, I'm Jim Karsten. For the past few years I have been working on an
e-commerce web site, developing the frontend with the magento platform
and the backend with the web2py framework. The project has included a
wide range of technologies including web2py MVC/MySQL development,
magento customization and custom APIs, web2py-jqgrid module, apache
remote server mappings, and MySQL replication.

Previously, I spent the 9 years developing Internet applications for the
Internet service provider, porchlight.ca. With porchlight.ca, I managed
a team of programmers. We developed many applications including an
automated call centre, a project management system, payroll and
accounting programs, applicant screening tools for human resources, and
web pages for customers to maintain their accounts online.

I love to code in python and am fluent in bash, HTML, CSS, javascript,
git, and MySQL. I work on Linux (Arch Linux) and have a pretty good
handle on networking, having set up and maintain a home network. In my
free time, I enjoy playing ultimate, hockey and golf.
