<h4>What do you mean &lsquo;workout partner&rsquo;?<a id="workout"></a></h4>

<p>A friend of mine got me involved in weight training a few years ago. He
introduced me to the basics and devised a workout program. His
enthusiasm kept me interested and I made very good progress. I have
since moved to Guelph and it is no longer practical to workout together.
I find on my own I am not quite as motivated and I haven&rsquo;t kept a
consistent program going. I would enjoy having a workout partner to get
back into it.</p>

<br>


<h4>Why would you <em>choose</em> to work in cubicles?<a id="cubicles"></a></h4>

<p>Cubicles are often the scorn of office design so why would we
voluntarily use them? Well they actually are pretty effective. The
cubicles are space efficient.  They cut down on noise.  The walls seem
to help with focus.  They are modular.  They have no drawers which
forces one to be organized.  AC power and ethernet are at desk height.</p>

<br>


<h4>What do you mean &lsquo;scheduling can be flexible&rsquo;?<a id="flexible"></a></h4>

<p>Ideally it&rsquo;s the same each week but this might not be practical.  A
schedule can be submitted a week before.</p>

<br>


<h4>Why must all the work be done on location?<a id="local"></a></h4>

<p>I find it helps with motivation and focus.  Staying motivated is
important in a small group.</p>

<br>


<h4>What is your address?<a id="address"></a></h4>

<p>79 Tovell Drive, Guelph</p>

<br>


<h4>I found a mistake.<a id="mistake"></a></h4>

<p>I found a spelling/grammar mistake.
I found a broken link.
I like to know the answer to this question&hellip;</p>

<p>Please email me mistakes as well anything you feel is missing &ndash;
