#### Technical Project Manager
We have a opening for a technical project manager. We are developing an
e-commerce website for a locally owned [retail
business](http://ellwoodepps.com). The first version is almost done but
there is more to do. The project manager will play a key role in
developing and implementing the second version.
[Duties](/questions.html#duties) include joining in on brainstorming
sessions, gathering requirements from client, writing specifications,
project management, delegating, outsourcing and people management,
testing, project fulfillment monitoring, and depending on your skills,
some coding.

We are a small company. There are just two of us.
[Jim](/about/jimk.html) and[ I ](/about/steve.html) do most of the work
ourselves but we have outsourced work using online freelancers. We'd
like to expand on that and the project manager will have a key role in
this. Our business touches on all facets of web development from user
interface design to network performance testing. There is plenty of
variety and no two days are the same.

The [environment](/about/environment.html) is casual. You will work very
closely with us. You could say we are '[flow](/questions.html#flow)'
junkies because we like to get into a zone with our work daily. For that
to continue, we're looking for someone with a similar
[disposition](/questions.html/#disposition). We've listed some our
the traits and the general
[characteristics](/questions.html/#characteristics) we're looking for.
