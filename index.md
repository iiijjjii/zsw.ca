#### Technical Project Manager
[My friend](/about/jimk.html) and[ I ](/about/steve.html) are interested
in finding someone who we can work closely with.  I guess you can say
we're a bit of '[flow](/questions.html#flow)' junkies and because of
this we feel it's important the person has similar
[characteristics](/questions.html#characteristics) to us. While working
in a unique [work environment](/about/environment.html), this person
must enjoy managing tasks and leading people.

We feel we have too much on our plates at this time.  Currently, we're
helping a friend of ours who runs a fair sized [sporting goods
company](http://ellwoodepps.com) (hunting, fishing and camping). Our
current goal is to give their customers the ability to purchase online.
