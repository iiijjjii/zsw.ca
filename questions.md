* [Workout buddy'?](#workout)

<br>
#### What skills are required?<a id="skills"></a>
* willingness to take ownership and responsibility in solving [end-user problems](#enduser)
* must possess exceptional organizational skills
* ability to communicate well both written and verbally
* ability to write clear, concise documentation
* ability to get things done
* able to brainstorm and think outside the box
* familiar with the Linux environment (eg cli, vim, git)
* familiarity with web development tools and languages, for example, any of
    python, HTML, CSS, and javascript, would be a plus

<br>
#### How much will I be paid?<a id="paid"></a>
Currently during the development phase, Jim and I are paying ourselves a base
salary to cover our cost of living. I'd like to sit down and figure out what
your needs are and negogiate a value that works for you.  When we start
generating revenue, with profit sharing our salaries can increase. As the
business grows so will its value. If we all gel really well and you are happy
to stay on long term, than Jim and I have no trouble doing a three way split of
equity. I'd just need our accountant to figure out how and when.

<br>
#### Why is it important to you that everyone have a similar disposition?<a id="disposition"></a>
A lot of time will be spent on brainstorming and decision making.
Hopefully we'll be more effective if we can focus on decisions involving
the direction of the project and immediate tasks at hand, rather than
resolving minor issues related to personal preferences.

Also, in a small group, each person represents a big chunk of the
organization. Their personality and characteristics are going to have an
impact on the resultant nature of the group. Whether personalities gel
or conflict will go a long way in determining if the project is
successful or not.

Characteristics and preferences that can affect how well we work
together include technical issues eg Linux vs Windows, personal
motivators eg customer oriented vs profit oriented, comfort zones eg a
quiet atmosphere vs social one, and philosophies eg simple vs dynamic.

As an example, while working at the ISP we employed two network
administrators. Both great guys, technically sound and agreeable to work
with, and they happened to be good friends outside of work. However, in
certain areas they had very different, almost opposing values. For
example, one was very comfortable with the Linux distribution Redhat,
whereas the other favoured Debian. When working on a project together,
if asked if their differences in Linux distro preferences would be a
problem, the answer was always "No, it's all Linux". Sure enough, not
long after you would hear them debating directory structure or what
version of this or that to use. Furthermore one was passionate about
speed and performance optimization, whereas the other filtered decisions
based on network security. These difference led to some lengthy meetings
and some serious disagreements.

We've found it important to consider all facets of a project, and people
with different backgrounds and preferences can help bring unique
perspectives to the table. But when differences consistently become an
issue, tempers may rise, projects are often delayed, and well, it's just
not an ideal environment to be in.

<br>
#### What characteristics are most important for this position?<a id="characteristics"></a>
In no particular order:
* Determination
* Simplicity
* Enthusiasm
* Creativity
* Self-Awareness
* Trustworthiness
* Leadership
* Methodicalness
* Self-Discipline
* Desire to Learn

<br>
#### Why is it important to you who you work with?<a id="who"></a>
The characteristics of the people that make up a group can have an
affect on productivity and the well-being of its members. The size of
the group, whether a management hierarchy is used and the type of people
that are brought together, all can potentially have a positive or
negative effect on motivation, brainstorming, and the enjoyment of the
work environment.

Motivation: Working with like-minded co-workers keeps motivation and
interest consistently high. Staying motivated is important for a small
group as so much depends on each person doing their part.

360 Brainstorming: If we make decisions on our own, we have only our own
perspective to consider. When we join with others we can come at a
problem from many different angles. Multiple perspectives alleviate a
good chunk of ignorance.

Environment: Rarely mentioned, and in our opinion, largely
underestimated, our environment has a great impact on who we are and who
we'll become. The culture in which we live and work affects our
behaviour and habits. People we spend time with shape us as we shape
them. We are deliberately choosing to be with people who we are
comfortable with, who enrich our experience and who we can have fun
developing with.

<br>
#### What is this 'flow' thing you refer to?<a id="flow"></a>
We use the word as coined by Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi, Creativity: Flow
and the Psychology of Discovery and Invention. From wikipedia,

"Flow is the mental state of operation in which the person is fully
immersed in what he or she is doing by a feeling of energized focus,
full involvement, and success in the process of the activity."[1]

In other words, an optimal challenge, getting "in the zone". If
happiness is the goal, then creating an environment where we can
maximize the opportunities for flow makes sense.

<br>
#### Why are co-workers important to flow?<a id="flow-ii"></a>
* In a small group, members are consistently faced with interesting
  challenges; rarely are tasks repetitive or boring.
* A small group reduces the number of distractions and interruptions.
* We are goal oriented. The end goal and how a task at hand contributes
  to that goal are always in mind. Clear goals are a factor in creating
  flow.

<br>
#### How would you describe an ideal co-worker?<a id="co-worker"></a>

* ability to take ownership and responsibility in the work
* possesses exceptional organizational skills
* a bit of an extrovert
* a generalist/a jack of all trades

* more interested in being good friends than a co-worker
* someone who treats work as a lifestyle versus a 9-5 job
* someone who has to try and limit their time in front of the
  computer versus wanting to leave at 5pm to pursue other interests
* interested in their well-being:
    * eating well
    * interested in cardio, weight and yoga training
    * always expanding their technical knowledge
* someone who has a contrasting skill set and varied experiences

* Honest and empathetic
* Easy going and down to earth, calm, like a reserved extrovert.
* Practical, logical, reasonable
* Open to what's not necessarily conventional but not unconventional for
  the sake of it.
* Passionate/driven in a calm, persistent way, not rah-rah

  computers to solve other peoples' problems, not to make a pile of
  cash, not for notoriety or ego.
* Enjoy simplicity, thinks less is more, tries to remove distractions
* Is a good [ultimate](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_(sport\))

#### How do you guys do your decision making?<a id="decision"></a>
Currently our decision making process is pretty informal. When an issue
arises we meet and discuss it. We start by getting a clear definition of
the problem, then we brainstorm possibilities. This can mean discussing
options together, or each going off and doing our own research, or just
thinking on it.

If we can't find any satisfactory solutions, we might take a step back
and rethink the problem. For example, are there some requirements that
can be made less restrictive or dropped altogether? Then we restart the
brainstorming process.

Once we have some options, we run them through a set of filters and
usually one stands out that we agree on.

<br>
#### What filters do you use when making decisions?<a id="filter"></a>
* What does the customer want?
* Keep it simple
* Try before you buy (is there an easy test?)
* What have others done? (google search)
* What is the cost? (time)
* What is the cost? (money)
* Is it flexible? (a precursor to 'optimize' and 'scalability')
* Does the outcome benefit other desired outcomes?
* Is it sustainable?
* Is it fair? (do unto others...)
* Is it redundant?

<br>
#### What will the working environment be like?<a id="environment"></a>
See [here](/about/environment.html).

<br>
#### Have you posted any code you've written?<a id="code"></a>
We posted links to code samples; [jim(http://FIXME) and
[steve](http://FIXME)

<br>
#### What software do you use to do your work?<a id="software"></a>
We work in a Linux environment and believe in open source software. Our
choice for a Linux distribution is Arch Linux.

We develop with bash and core utils (awk, sed, find etc), python, web2py,
magento, apache, MySQL and nagios. The software we choose to work with
includes: dwm, urxvt, screen, bash, vim, firefox (pentadactyl), mutt, weechat,
rtorrent, mplayer and mpd.

Here are our dotfiles; [jim](http://FIXME) and [steve](http://FIXME)

<br>
#### What hardware do you use?<a id="hardware"></a>
* Lenovo Thinkpad x220 w/ultabase, 24" LCD, MS 4000N keyboard
* 2 x Dell PowerEdge 860
* TP Link TL-WR1043ND -- running openwrt
* NMT, 1080p Mitsubishi HC5000 projector
* HP Colour LaserJet 2605 printer
* HP Scanjet 8250
* VPS -- linode

<br>
#### How do you balance work and personal time?<a id="time"></a>
Over the years work and personal time have meshed into a lifestyle. We
basically try to limit ourselves to 60 hours a week of being in the same
room working on problems we brainstormed up. Generally it's 9 to 9
Monday to Friday.

We usually play ultimate one or two nights a week in Guelph.

Jim lives in Listowel from Friday night to Monday morning. On weekends
he plays golf in the summer and hockey in the winter.

Most of our conversations revolve around computers (Hacker News, new
technology, tweaking our computers) or sports (Leafs/Raptors/Blue
Jays/NFL).

<br>
#### What is your work ethic like?<a id="work-ethic"></a>
It's tempting to reply "super work ethic, self starter, willingness to go
above and beyond" but does that really say anything? Most everyone says
that about anything work related, and it can mean different things to
different people.

For example, before he retired, my father had a shitty job at a food
processing plant. He got up every morning, showed up on time at a
workplace filled with people with a i'd-rather-not-be-here attitude. He
dumped garbage bins eight hours a day. He worked at the same company for
35 years. That takes an unbelievable amount of determination, focus, and
self-discipline. I would say he had a good work ethic.

We have nothing close to that. All the same we were able to make an ISP
happen. We grew a successful business by plucking away usually 60 plus
hours a week at our computers. Some would say that's a good work ethic.
I don't know; some was work but we had a lot of fun doing it.

I think of work as doing tasks which I do not want to do. The main
reason anyone would do this on a consistent basis is for money. I think
of *leisure* as doing what I want, when I want, at my own pace, all the
while learning something new. I'd call that sustainable fun. If I can
channel this within the framework of a business, then it seems I can
earn a living as well.

<br>
#### What do you mean 'workout buddy'?<a id="workout"></a>
A friend of mine got me involved in weight training a few years ago. He
introduced me to the basics and devised a workout program. His enthusiasm kept
me interested and I made very good progress. I have since moved to Guelph and
it is no longer practical to workout together. I find on my own I am not quite
as motivated and I haven't kept a consistent program going. I would enjoy
having a workout buddy to get back into it.

<br>
#### What do you mean 'end-user problems'?<a id="enduser"></a>
Some people suggest a successful business can come about by creating a product
or service which scratches a personal itch.  The thinking goes if you have a
problem most likely others do too. You know the problem domain well since it
keeps cropping up in your environment and you are highly motivated to create a
solution as it will resolve an on-going nag. Many successful companies and
products, for example, google, skype, and twitter, came about with this
approach. The downside I see to this approach is it runs the risk of solving
a problem only a few people have, which doesn't lend to growth, and,
because your focus is so much on a solution that you are happy with, your
product might not be suitable for what the majority of people need or want. 

I have tried this approach with minor projects and I find it hard to get a good
feel of the dimension of a task. I have little depth perception. It's hard to
gauge what is a priority and what isn't. It's difficult to determine the value
of some feature or aspect of the project and how much resources should be
applied to it. I find it difficult to know when it is 'done'. Lastly, in the
long run I find working on other peoples problems rather than my own to be more
fulfilling.

Currently we our developing an e-commerce site. The end-user is the [sporting
good store](http://ellwoodepps.com) and the problems are obvious. They have a
large customer base and their requests and feedback from the employees provide
ample evidence of what needs improving and where the prioriites need to be
focused. By solving these 'end-user problems' we create immediate benefits,
something clients are willing to pay for. This business model may not make us
gazillionaires but I think it has a much better chance of long term success
than trying the hit-and-miss approach of developing the next skype or twitter.

<br>
#### Why would you *choose* to work in cubicles?<a id="cubicles"></a>
Cublicles are often the scorn of office design so why would we voluntarily use
them? Well they actually are pretty effective. The cubicles are space
efficient.  They cut down on noise.  The walls seem to help with focus.  They
are modular.  They have no drawers which forces you to be organized.  AC power
and ethernet are at desk height. Hey, what's not to like.
