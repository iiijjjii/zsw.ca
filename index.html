<h4>Technical Project Manager</h4>

<p>We have a opening for a technical project manager. We are developing an
e-commerce website for a locally owned <a href="http://ellwoodepps.com">retail
business</a>. The first version is almost done but
there is more to do. The project manager will play a key role in
developing and implementing the second version.
<a href="/questions.html#duties">Duties</a> include joining in on brainstorming
sessions, gathering requirements from client, writing specifications,
project management, delegating, outsourcing and people management,
testing, project fulfillment monitoring, and depending on your skills,
some coding.</p>

<p>We are a small company. There are just two of us. Jim and I do most of
the work ourselves, but we have outsourced work using online
freelancers. We&rsquo;d like to expand on that and the project manager will
have a key role in this. Our business touches on all facets of web
development from user interface design to network performance testing.
There is plenty of variety and no two days are the same.</p>

<p>The <a href="/about/environment.html">environment</a> is casual. You will work very
closely with us. You could say we are &lsquo;<a href="/questions.html#flow">flow</a>&rsquo;
junkies because we like to get into a zone with our work daily. For that
to continue, we&rsquo;re looking for someone with a similar
<a href="/questions.html/#disposition">disposition</a> as us. We&rsquo;ve listed some our
the traits and the general
