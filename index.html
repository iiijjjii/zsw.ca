time. The position is 10 to 20 hours per week, ideal for a student, and
the schedule is flexible. The <a href="/about/environment.html">environment</a> is

developing an e-commerce website for a locally owned <a href="http://ellwoodepps.com">retail
business</a>.  We have spent the better part of a
year focused on the project and are close to releasing version 1.0. Many

need help with them. Since we are a small company the jobs vary in
nature from technical to non-technical.</p>
