<h4>Technical Project Manager</h4>

<p><a href="/about/jimk.html">My friend</a> and<a href="/about/steve.html"> I </a> are interested
in finding someone who we can work closely with.  I guess you can say
we&rsquo;re a bit of &lsquo;<a href="/questions.html#flow">flow</a>&rsquo; junkies and because of
this we feel it&rsquo;s important the person has similar
<a href="/questions.html#characteristics">characteristics</a> to us. While working
in a unique <a href="/about/environment.html">work environment</a>, this person
must enjoy managing tasks and leading people.</p>

<p>We feel we have too much on our plates at this time.  Currently, we&rsquo;re
helping a friend of ours who runs a fair sized <a href="http://ellwoodepps.com">sporting goods
company</a> (hunting, fishing and camping). Our
current goal is to give their customers the ability to purchase online.</p>

<h5>Overview</h5>

<ul>
<li>ability to work in north west Guelph, Ontario</li>
<li>would enjoy working in a unique <a href="/about/environment.html">work environment</a></li>
<li>really enjoy working in a small group</li>
<li>familiar with the Linux environment (eg cli, vim, git)</li>
<li>familiarity with python would be a plus</li>
<li>ability to take ownership and responsibility in the work</li>
<li>possesses exceptional organizational skills</li>
<li>a bit of an extrovert</li>
<li>a generalist/a jack of all trades</li>
</ul>
